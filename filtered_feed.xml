Bittersweet this morning. There's not another personality around like Iggy Strode. Iggy's rolodex. Jackson has a dossier ready to go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One segment down and Martin is thinking about quitting. Joey Vitale is up and listening and his nips are hard. The formula for creating a TMA text name. Tough one for Mizzou on Saturday, especially after Brady Cook went down. Drew Pyne may not be the guy. The Tigers laid two eggs against their two biggest opponents. Big miss to not have a backup QB. Luther Burden had 3 catches for 3 yards. Lots of talent back from last season but it just hasn't translated. Our niche is homoerotic sports radio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chariman Kurt "met" the love of his life in Tuscaloosa. Met might be the wrong word as he didn't exactly talk to her. She just had an aura about her. Would she have been willing to date an older fella? The Hinge and Bumble scene down in Alabama. Hard to bring a girl back to the Red Roof Inn with your dad in the same room. The needlepoint belts were all over the place. Doug is officiating the Plowhawk's wedding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martin has prepared a poem for us. Jackson may or may not have given out the wrong phone number. Not sure who is going to filter the phone calls during this moment of transition.

Except the Pirates, they've got some walk-ons. Win the press conference, not the offseason. The Yankees and Red Sox arms race in the early 2000's. Winning the '06 and '11 World Series solidified a mindset with the Cardinals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(36:22-49:49) New College Football Playoffs rankings are out. Chairman's search for tiger-striped dress is dead. There's a chance the Big XII could be left out. The committee focusing more on the wins than the losses. Three loss South Carolina can make a jump if they beat Clemson. It's running up the score SZN.

Gabe's not happy about the 6PM kickoff against the Minutemen. The SEC's annual opponents have come out and Mizzou will get Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas A&amp;amp;M. Gabe will not apologize for not knowing who Matthew Tkachuk was. UMass doesn't have much that scares Gabe. Bobby Boots. Ahmad Hardy, Beau Pribula and the offense clicking. Jayven Richardson stepped in and looked good. Looking ahead at the remaining schedule. Seems like Mizzou &lt;em&gt;COULD&lt;/em&gt; win every game left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; and California Privacy Notice at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://mgln.ai/e/345/pscrb.fm/rss/p/rss.art19.com/episodes/57dfc499-aef6-4ae7-a11d-a90e5ad1594f.mp3?rss_browser=BAhJIg9mZWVkcGFyc2VyBjoGRVQ%3D--6249cc52a45c5995843f2b1fcedbd2955c2d7057" length="68284081" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TMA (9-22-25) Hour 3 - Little Finebaum</title><description>&lt;p&gt;(00:00-11:20) Jackson is being taken to ask for his Dabo Swinney to Bama or LSU take.

Bring it up with Big Pharma. Some MLB races coming down to the wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(34:26-57:21) Big sports weekend but we're talking pharmacist vs. plumbers. Good weekend to punt on going to the Mizzou game. Jackson, give us the format for the Ryder Cup. Text in with an open heart. Doug had some sick interns. The Chairman has a sick academic resume.

Fan angst meter. Miles Mikolas most likely won't be back. We got a close out at the Ryder Cup. DeChambeau and Thomas go down. Don't say pegged. Home teams tend to be the favorite. Bummer this Cards Cubs series at Wrigley means nothing. Can't teach these scars, man. How many Ivy League listeners do we have right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(16:13-29:15) Ain't no sunshine. Jackson's lost the plot. Jackson could only play one song on the saxophone. Doug thought he may go to jail yesterday. Kids on leashes. What colors are Brown University? Is spinning our wheels different from clearing the deck? You need a 4.0 GPA and a 33-35 ACT to get into Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(29:25-37:19) Mt.

The best Tims. Chalamet doesn't count. Tim has his first comedy special out on Nate Bargatze's YouTube channel. Is Tim's comedy clean or does he get in the dirt and roll around? Dating in NYC. Tim's avoided the dating apps. It's a cold world on the dating apps in St. Louis. Chairman's focused on Beau Pribula right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(13:50-25:05) It's not George Harrison's birthday. Tough day so far in the Ryder Cup.
