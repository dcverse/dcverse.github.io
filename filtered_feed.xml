Bittersweet this morning. There's not another personality around like Iggy Strode. Iggy's rolodex. Jackson has a dossier ready to go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One segment down and Martin is thinking about quitting. Joey Vitale is up and listening and his nips are hard. The formula for creating a TMA text name. Tough one for Mizzou on Saturday, especially after Brady Cook went down. Drew Pyne may not be the guy. The Tigers laid two eggs against their two biggest opponents. Big miss to not have a backup QB. Luther Burden had 3 catches for 3 yards. Lots of talent back from last season but it just hasn't translated. Our niche is homoerotic sports radio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chariman Kurt "met" the love of his life in Tuscaloosa. Met might be the wrong word as he didn't exactly talk to her. She just had an aura about her. Would she have been willing to date an older fella? The Hinge and Bumble scene down in Alabama. Hard to bring a girl back to the Red Roof Inn with your dad in the same room. The needlepoint belts were all over the place.

Except the Pirates, they've got some walk-ons. Win the press conference, not the offseason. The Yankees and Red Sox arms race in the early 2000's. Winning the '06 and '11 World Series solidified a mindset with the Cardinals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(36:22-49:49) New College Football Playoffs rankings are out. Chairman's search for tiger-striped dress is dead. There's a chance the Big XII could be left out. The committee focusing more on the wins than the losses. Three loss South Carolina can make a jump if they beat Clemson. It's running up the score SZN.

Gabe's not happy about the 6PM kickoff against the Minutemen. The SEC's annual opponents have come out and Mizzou will get Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Texas A&amp;amp;M. Gabe will not apologize for not knowing who Matthew Tkachuk was. UMass doesn't have much that scares Gabe. Bobby Boots. Ahmad Hardy, Beau Pribula and the offense clicking. Jayven Richardson stepped in and looked good. Looking ahead at the remaining schedule. Seems like Mizzou &lt;em&gt;COULD&lt;/em&gt; win every game left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; and California Privacy Notice at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://mgln.ai/e/345/pscrb.fm/rss/p/rss.art19.com/episodes/57dfc499-aef6-4ae7-a11d-a90e5ad1594f.mp3?rss_browser=BAhJIg9mZWVkcGFyc2VyBjoGRVQ%3D--6249cc52a45c5995843f2b1fcedbd2955c2d7057" length="68284081" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TMA (9-22-25) Hour 3 - Little Finebaum</title><description>&lt;p&gt;(00:00-11:20) Jackson is being taken to ask for his Dabo Swinney to Bama or LSU take.

Not sure there's a fit with Kyrou and the Maple Leafs right now. Jackson is responding through drops. Tim wants 364 designated as the best road in all of St. Louis. STOP TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT 364. Jackson loves autumnal drives and fall sunsets. PCP's got a nice ass. Getting deported from Cottleville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(17:57-19:56) Continuing the horny music theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(20:06-35:46) Doug, what about that Fiona Apple? How do tornados work? We respect golf course employees and their airhorns. Audio of Danny Kanell saying he's done with a G5 team getting an autobid into the College Football Playoffs. The five-seed is the sweet spot to be in for the CFP. Is Lex Luthor playing a character?

It's hard to dance with really tall guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5:36-13:16) Is this Justify My Love? We're passionate about our monogamy.

Top offensive players not getting much done. Martin's got his rightsholder's Blues glasses. Doug's not plowing anyone. Jackson's handicap and ruined psyche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(16:02-40:53) Happy 80th Birthday, Neil Young. What would Wall Street look like with a mermaid? Per the Gabe DeArmond of Penn State, Drink to Happy Valley is picking up a little momentum. Jackson doesn't wanna do Man on the Street anymore. If Drink left how would the fan base feel about James Franklin? Go get your bag. Tom O'Toole will be joining us later with an announcement on Normandie Golf Course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(41:03-49:46) How come we haven't mentioned the big Illini win? Jackson's love for basketball is so hoth. Audio of Jordan Binnington talking about the milestone of passing Mike Liut for most games played in franchise history.

Calm down, Doug. The Normandie Golf Club at Emerson Park. Big $7M donation from Emerson. Expectations for when the course will be open to the public. How the course will be different from the original. Is Iggy still a made man at the new Normandie?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(20:02-32:32) Martin is forced to issue an apology. Sometimes The Antlers are a little much. Denim fashion is all over the place. Jackson sent a link about Sophie Cunningham but it may just be a nothing burger. Nothing Burgers vs. Impossible Burgers. She's no Tim but she's a good interview. Riley Green is chiseled. For Doug's eyes only. This show doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(32:42-42:50) Changing our tune after a downtrodden Monday. Why do the producers of this show go on vacation with other guys? Sometimes you just gotta get away with the boys. What makes something a "town car?" Sleeping on a windowsill in the Smokey Mountains. Doug's not making marriage sound very appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; and California Privacy Notice at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://mgln.ai/e/345/pscrb.fm/rss/p/rss.art19.com/episodes/d9fdd52d-b4c4-41d9-afda-c2c6afeebf4f.mp3?rss_browser=BAhJIg9mZWVkcGFyc2VyBjoGRVQ%3D--6249cc52a45c5995843f2b1fcedbd2955c2d7057" length="41264692" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TMA (11-12-25) Hour 3 - Scout Before You Sit</title><description>&lt;p&gt;(00:00-15:45) Our Blues insider Jeremy Rutherford stops by the studio for some Blues talk and two-part questions. Does JR think Binnington will go down as the best goalie in franchise history? Joe Strauss tales. Rotel for breakfast. How would JR fix Hooterville? Good to get a win last night but not terribly impressed. Is Doug Armstrong open for business? JR has a two-parter for us. Toilet paper shaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(15:54-33:13) You wanted HOV, you got it, Doug. Jackson's workshopping a Deep Cut Thursday. Audio of Jim Montgomery talking about the final four minutes of last night's win. Doug thinks these guys have to be better than they've been so far. What do you mean by 'Pony?' White Castles and a Friday night Blues game. Spilling burger in the car. Ticket prices for Mizzou and Mississippi State have plummeted. Jackson still hoping to go to Columbia on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(33:23-43:45) This is as about as sick of a Ween Wednesday as you can get.

That place is just kinda depressing. Busch 2 vs. Busch 3. The Rams Rules. Still hard to believe one of the best teams in NFL history played on that field. Just chop the top. Jackson's stance on retractable roofs is well documented. Maybe SLU can start a team and play at The Dome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(15:47-33:20) Is the song Return of the Mack about a cuck sitch? Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, Doug. This bird sanctuary idea has legs, or wings. Audio from Drink last night on Tiger Talk talking about Mizzou making the leap from good to great. Another audio clip of Drink talking about college fans having a "CFP or bust" mentality. Crumb bums.

Thursday Throwdown. Welcome back, Bob. Like a fortress. Fight Tiger (basketball). We're like five presidents just sittin' around. The Irish guy comes through, make a note. This planet's not gonna be around much longer. Doug, do you want Steve in Wildwood or Dan Janson? Let's hear from Steve first. Rene Knott got hit by a bus. No room at Algonquin. Doug, you think Wellington's hot? Bracketology in November. Half my sons. Tufts for seniors. The Polar Express and Rumpleminze Santa. Even bums get presents.

Audio of Florida interim coach Billy Gonzales being asked if Lane Kiffin would be a good fit at Florida. Good non-answer. Why'd you send the money, Lix? Shoutout the listener who sent Jackson tickets for the Mizzou game. There's a shrub on the dais. Who has blonde shrubs? Infidelity by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(52:28-1:11:42) Great to be reunited with Robert Thomas. Robert's assessment of the Blues' slow start. What does the team need to do to get back to their winning ways? Monty's playlist. Missing Jake Neighbours. Getting over the Game 7 loss to the Jets last year. The Tkachuk boys starting a podcast.

Shrewsbury Seminary Student on the phone lines. Question about the TMA Reddit. Finally cleared to swim again after his snipping. Does Doug wanna hit the sauna with him? Protein bar talk. Municipality warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(20:40-30:10) This doesn't sound like South Pacific to me. There's a fight brewing in the YouTube chat between Cucky and Jake in St. Gen. Roll Tide is on the phone lines with a question about fandom. Do you have to have gone to a school to be a fan? There's that sinister laugh again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(30:20-53:02) This is a Detroit Pistons town. Billikens coach Josh Schertz checks in with us on the phone line.

Audio of Lane Kiffin's confrontation with Ben Garrett over Garrett's use of a Ludacris lyric. What's Yentl got to do with any of this?

Doug's not gonna be good to us this year. Today starts the brand new EMOTD competition. Arbor Day is an institution. Do you want a new HVAC or not, lady? The most substantial Sadie Hawkins Doug has ever had. Rough night for the Ravens kicker last night. Not just a fat, a guy fat. NFL playoff picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(26:50-56:45) Doug forgot about The Gator Bowl. Conflicting feedback on Jackson's "Best Of" work for break. Blues with a couple of wins over the holiday break. Non Gay isn't convinced just yet. Harrison's Brother Master with a Jordan Kyrou update. Sharon joins him in one of the most hated alliances of all-time. Doug can't eat lamb. Tim's financial future is tied to the Miami Hurricanes. Austin Simmons sounds like he may be coming to Columbia. Indiana not getting due respect. Maybe Drink wasn't in the hunt for the Penn State job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(56:55-1:08:10) SMASH that like button. Someone bought Jackson a beer in honor of Tim. How was the scene at Duke's? Big weekend of CFB and NFL playoffs coming up. Audio of both Mike Francesa and Mad Dog Russo struggling to pronounce Jaxon Smith-Njigba's name. Jackson hasn't shaved in a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; and California Privacy Notice at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://mgln.ai/e/345/pscrb.fm/rss/p/rss.art19.com/episodes/02e9c05a-bf83-4a3f-a8cd-ff9d85a42f8a.mp3?rss_browser=BAhJIg9mZWVkcGFyc2VyBjoGRVQ%3D--6249cc52a45c5995843f2b1fcedbd2955c2d7057" length="65588662" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TMA (1-5-26) Hour 2 - The Hawk Will Never Die</title><description>&lt;p&gt;(00:00-9:28) Joined by voice of the Blues, Chris Kerber, who is enjoying a couple of days without a game. Getting all four points against VGK and Montreal. Doug Armstrong knows what kind of team he has and what direction he wants to go. Getting Binnington re-energized playing for Team Canada. Talking goal-scoring and the lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(9:36-28:19) What's the filtered file looking like so far this morning? People started early. Say it slower, Tim. Sounds like Jackson is being sarcastic. Running around naked at the MAC over break. Jackson didn't watch a minute of Blues hockey. Billikens did a little skull pounding over the break. That eagle was flapping his wings non-stop. No one wants to hear that Tim chased around a bunch of high school boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(28:29-46:20) Joined by Gabe DeArmond of Power Mizzou. Talking Mizzou and the transfer portal. Gabe's assessment of Austin Simmons. Play calling in The Gator Bowl. Mizzou basketball's performance in their win over Florida. Talking college football calendar and the remainder of the College Football Playoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; and California Privacy Notice at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://mgln.ai/e/345/pscrb.fm/rss/p/rss.art19.com/episodes/b7c2ce2d-ee23-4795-ba9f-31a09e05238e.mp3?rss_browser=BAhJIg9mZWVkcGFyc2VyBjoGRVQ%3D--6249cc52a45c5995843f2b1fcedbd2955c2d7057" length="44634279" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TMA (1-6-25) Hour 3 - I Want My Sunset &amp; I Want It Now</title><description>&lt;p&gt;(00:00-16:49) Everybody is really on edge with the first EMOTD of the new year coming up. Jackson pulled audio galore. Let's hear a "So What'd Your Grandma Think?" featuring Will Wade, coach of NC State basketball not happy with the question regarding Darrion Williams. Top paid coaches in college football. Audio of Dan Lanning talking about his team's performance in their 23-0 win over Texas Tech. On-campus playoff games and bowl games. Jackson wasn't pleased with the lack of a sunset at The Rose Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(16:57-31:25) Doug, welcome to history. Lack of wit, girth, or potential FCC violations get you disqualified. Let's read the e-mails for the EMOTD. Secret ballots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(31:35-48:05) Surprisingly enough they weren't happy with the first day of the EMOTD and the filtering process. James Carlton is in-studio. James called The Hoosiers routing The Tide. Any of the four teams remaining could win it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; and California Privacy Notice at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://mgln.ai/e/345/pscrb.fm/rss/p/rss.art19.com/episodes/f4e7a37e-d792-4cf4-af2b-d8825b8f8667.mp3?rss_browser=BAhJIg9mZWVkcGFyc2VyBjoGRVQ%3D--6249cc52a45c5995843f2b1fcedbd2955c2d7057" length="46308205" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TMA (1-5-26) Hour 4 - Poors Need Not Apply &amp; EMOTD Results</title><description>&lt;p&gt;(00:00-8:55) Not a dry eye at Ronnies. Happy birthday Bradley Cooper. Did Jackson vomit at Duke's the other night? Getting your C legs. Do they still use sawdust in schools to clean up vomit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(9:03-15:54) Jackson missed this song so much he listened to it over break. Pseudo interview shows. Blues Money Puck update. Doug's not looking forward to the Cardinal season. Turning the page to butt ass, but at least they're turning the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(16:04-19:10) It's time to announce the winner of Day 1 of the EMOTD competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See Privacy Policy at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy&lt;/a&gt; and California Privacy Notice at &lt;a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><enclosure url="https://mgln.ai/e/345/pscrb.fm/rss/p/rss.art19.com/episodes/60e2de6d-43c4-4959-b7b2-956edf3ffb5b.mp3?rss_browser=BAhJIg9mZWVkcGFyc2VyBjoGRVQ%3D--6249cc52a45c5995843f2b1fcedbd2955c2d7057" length="18555715" type="audio/mpeg"/><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TMA (1-6-26) Hour 1 - A Raucous Ruckus</title><description>&lt;p&gt;(00:00-21:10) Do we lede with the Steve Kerr ejection? Chasing referees with full vigor. Sharon's at the pool already. I don't care if there's any meat below it. Might need an intervention. The Brothers Grimm version of clothing. St. Louis loves Marco. After a bonding day yesterday things are back to normal today. Martin had to break the tie yesterday. Too poor for an HVAC. Big win for the Kraken. Billy Walsh's Pablo Escobar tattoo. Landing strap. Button Me. A thirst for drops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(21:18-50:39) Lotta good overbearing sports dads out there. It's hard. It's bang bang. Shaking my ass during prayer. Will Joe Buck be at the Indiana/Oregon game? Kicked in the eye by a seven year old. Rim protection. A Frank Cusumano, Josch Schertz, Paul Mano story. Fries on the down low. Spoon Ball. Mood rings. Larry Nickel on hold and he feels left behind. Adam from Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(50:49-1:08:08) Why didn't you go with Can You Stand The Rain? Brody Herman in studio. You like a good meat carving station? Big raffle. Brody's takes on the CFP Final 4. Austin Simmons signed with Mizzou this morning.

Your Nancy Drew books. Will Jordan Walker remember he owes us an interview? Audio of Jim Bowden on MLB players realizing that athletes in other sports receive more revenue sharing money, and that can be fixed with a salary floor. Monster numbers for the college bowl games. Landman. Chevy Chase. Jackson's Golden State Valkyries hat may have broken the text inbox. Some people very....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(27:50-44:46) Doug still needs new headphones. The audience is rattled by Jackson's WNBA hat. Is MLB losing fans because of the W? Audio of DK Metcalf talking about the incident with the fan in Detroit. The WNBA guy got the bat signal and is on the phone lines to talk MLB and WNBA.
