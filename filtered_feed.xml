Bittersweet this morning. There's not another personality around like Iggy Strode. Iggy's rolodex. Jackson has a dossier ready to go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One segment down and Martin is thinking about quitting. Joey Vitale is up and listening and his nips are hard. The formula for creating a TMA text name. Tough one for Mizzou on Saturday, especially after Brady Cook went down. Drew Pyne may not be the guy. The Tigers laid two eggs against their two biggest opponents. Big miss to not have a backup QB. Luther Burden had 3 catches for 3 yards. Lots of talent back from last season but it just hasn't translated. Our niche is homoerotic sports radio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chariman Kurt "met" the love of his life in Tuscaloosa. Met might be the wrong word as he didn't exactly talk to her. She just had an aura about her. Would she have been willing to date an older fella? The Hinge and Bumble scene down in Alabama. Hard to bring a girl back to the Red Roof Inn with your dad in the same room. The needlepoint belts were all over the place. Doug is officiating the Plowhawk's wedding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martin has prepared a poem for us. Jackson may or may not have given out the wrong phone number. Not sure who is going to filter the phone calls during this moment of transition.

Except the Pirates, they've got some walk-ons. Win the press conference, not the offseason. The Yankees and Red Sox arms race in the early 2000's. Winning the '06 and '11 World Series solidified a mindset with the Cardinals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;(36:22-49:49) New College Football Playoffs rankings are out. Chairman's search for tiger-striped dress is dead. There's a chance the Big XII could be left out. The committee focusing more on the wins than the losses. Three loss South Carolina can make a jump if they beat Clemson. It's running up the score SZN.
