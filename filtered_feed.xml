Bittersweet this morning. There's not another personality around like Iggy Strode. Iggy's rolodex. Jackson has a dossier ready to go.

One segment down and Martin is thinking about quitting. Joey Vitale is up and listening and his nips are hard. The formula for creating a TMA text name. Tough one for Mizzou on Saturday, especially after Brady Cook went down. Drew Pyne may not be the guy. The Tigers laid two eggs against their two biggest opponents. Big miss to not have a backup QB. Luther Burden had 3 catches for 3 yards. Lots of talent back from last season but it just hasn't translated. Our niche is homoerotic sports radio.

Chariman Kurt "met" the love of his life in Tuscaloosa. Met might be the wrong word as he didn't exactly talk to her. She just had an aura about her. Would she have been willing to date an older fella? The Hinge and Bumble scene down in Alabama. Hard to bring a girl back to the Red Roof Inn with your dad in the same room. The needlepoint belts were all over the place. Doug is officiating the Plowhawk's wedding.

Martin has prepared a poem for us. Jackson may or may not have given out the wrong phone number. Not sure who is going to filter the phone calls during this moment of transition. Martin meets Libby Jack.

(9:20-22:43) Hey, Doug, it's Andy Crouppen. The NFL likes when you sue em a couple three times. Fixing St. Louis's problems start with acknowledging St. Louis's problems. KMOX? Never heard of her. The sibling rivalry between the city and the county.

(22:44-43:36) It's time for Martin's surprise guest. Jackson may have ruined the surprise with a tweet. The Governor Steve Kline joins us. Enjoying life as a college coach. The cradle of coaches. Missing the stag bars. Has one of his players ever flipped him the bird? Banned from Cardinals Fantasy Camp. The Interrogator.

(43:37-46:58) Fun night in NYC last night. Hoping that'll give the boys a little momentum going forward.

Montgomery the right coach at the right time for connecting with young players. How long can this new coach bump last?

(13:29-23:20) Jackson's been waiting on this topic for a few hours now. Takes on Danny Hurley gettin' T'd up in OT in the loss to Memphis. How do you get so angry in a guayabera shirt? Chairman used to get run out of SLABA games.

Getting hate for staying in St. Louis. Manual stimulation night at the Ballpark. TLR's Goldberg t-shirt. Skanksgiving Depression.

(24:31-36:21) Doug, what's the lede? The Dodgers can't stop signing big contracts. They's on scholarship too. Except the Pirates, they've got some walk-ons. Win the press conference, not the offseason. The Yankees and Red Sox arms race in the early 2000's. Winning the '06 and '11 World Series solidified a mindset with the Cardinals.

(36:22-49:49) New College Football Playoffs rankings are out. Chairman's search for tiger-striped dress is dead. There's a chance the Big XII could be left out. The committee focusing more on the wins than the losses. Three loss South Carolina can make a jump if they beat Clemson. It's running up the score SZN. No motivation to schedule quality non-conference opponents.

(49:50-51:23) Hoping Jackson waking up Robert Thomas isn't an issue. May wanna bet New Jersey.

Not easy losing Drew Bannister but excited about getting a coach like Jim Montgomery. Young players trying to live up to the hype. Addressing the "Take Your Shirt Off" comment after the win on Monday. Can media call players by their nickname?

(15:19-34:12) Jackson's feeling absolved from any Robert Thomas guilt. We're huge in Puerto Rico. Shoresy. Maybe it was a horned up boy. Chaser's Shouldys. We're gonna do Rivers now! Hi, Jamie. Talkin' new coach bump.

(34:13-46:48) Jackson was presented with an award during the break. Take your shirt off, Jack. JB gives an acceptance speech and it's moving. Remember Trung Canidate?

(16:59-26:36) The Dodgers assembling themselves a nice little all-star team. Sonny Gray, now we're talking. Jackson declares you can't win a World Series on paper. Would the Dodgers be interested in Nolan Arenado? Red Sox keep coming up in regards to Arenado.

(26:37-35:59) Looking like Cook and Burden's last games on Saturday. Audio of Brady Cook talking about his legacy at Mizzou. Where does the 2023 team rank all-time at Mizzou? What might have been with Jayden Daniels in a Tiger uniform. Is Doug Tiger Nationalizing?

(19:29-27:44) Chairman doesn't have a LinkedIn page. Recovering Alcoholic from Belleville &amp; Webster Groves checking on the phone lines. Here for the milking. A Cam Janssen statue with a nice bulge. Ice heads from Dupo. Staten Island is the Jefferson County of the New York burrows.

(27:45-32:44) RIP DMX. DMX gave a sermon at Hooterville. Wide Berth Wednesday. Social faux pas. Rawdogging is timeless.
